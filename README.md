# HST - Heterogeneous Scheduling Task
A User Mode Scheduler for FreeRTOS.

## Overview
This project implements a user-level scheduler through a user-level task, called *Heterogeneous Scheduling Task* (HST), in order to support Mixed Critical Systems in a very flexible way, in the FreeRTOS Real-Time Operating System (www.freertos.org).

The design is documented with detail in: *FreeRTOS User Mode Scheduler for Mixed Critical Systems*, Francisco E. Páez, José M. Urriza, Ricardo Cayssials, Javier D. Orozco. 2015 Sixth Argentine Conference on Embedded Systems (CASE). ISBN 978-987-45523-4-1, pp. 37-42, 2015.

The `FreeRTOS` directory contains a copy of the FreeRTOS source code for the ARM Cortex-M3 port. A copy of the mbed Microcontroller Library for the mbed LPC 1768 can be found in the `mbed` directory.

## Examples
See the `EXAMPLES` directory for instructions on how to build example programs that implements multiples scheduling algorithms by means of the HST.
