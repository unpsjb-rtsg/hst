# mbed libraries
This directory contains copies of the mbed library (v2) for different developement boards. 

To choose which version to use for building the examples projects, change the `BOARD` parameter of the `Makefile.mine` file to one of these values:
* `lpc1768`: mbed LPC1768 board.
* `nucleo_f103rb`: NUCLEO-F103RB, based on the STM32F103RBT6 microcontroller.
* `nucleo_f411re`: NUCLEO-F411RE, using an STM32F411RET6 microcontroller.
